== Null Values

While a `HashMap` supports `null` keys and `null` values most cache implementations and the JCache standard
do not. By default, cache2k does not permit `null` values, to avoid surprises, but storing `null` values
can be allowed with a configuration parameter.

=== The Pros and Cons of Nulls

A good writeup of the topic can be found at
https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained[Using and Avoiding Null Explained].
The bottom line is, that for a map it is always better to store no mapping instead of a mapping to a `null` value.
For a cache it is a different story, since the absence of a mapping can mean two things: The data was
not requested from the source yet, or, there is no data.

=== Negative Result Caching

Caching that there is no result or a failure, is also called "negative result caching" or "negative caching".
An example use case is the request of a database entry by primary key, for example via JPA's `EntityManager.find()`
which returns an object if it is available in the database or `null` if it is not. Caching a negative result
can make sense when requests that generate a negative result are common.

In a Java API negative results are quite often modeled with a `null` value. By enabling `null` support in
cache2k no further wrapping is required.

=== Alternatives

In a JCache application a `null` from the `CacheLoader` means the entry should be removed from the cache.
This semantic is a consistent definition, but if `Cache.get()` is used to check whether data is
existing, no caching happens if no data is present. A `null` value is passed through consistently, however,
the cache performs badly if a `null` response is common.

Being able to store a `null` value is no essential cache feature, since it is always possible
to store a wrapper object in the cache. However, with the `null` support in cache2k, it is
possible to store a `null` value with no additional overhead.

=== Default Behavior

By default, every attempt to store a `null` in the cache will yield a `NullPointerException`.

In case `peek()` returns `null`, this means there is no associated entry to this
key in the cache. The same holds for `get()` if no loader is defined. For one point
in time and one key there is the following invariant: `cache.contains(key) == (cache.peek(key) != null)`.

=== How to Enable Null Values

Storing of `null` values can be enabled by `permitNullValues(true)`. Example:

[source,java]
----
    Cache<Integer, Person> cache =
      new Cache2kBuilder<Integer, Person>(){}
        .name("persons")
        .entryCapacity(10000)
        .expireAfterWrite(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
        .permitNullValues(true)
        .build();
----

=== How to Operate with Null Values

When `null` values are legal, additional care must be taken. The typical cache aside pattern becomes invalid:

[source,java]
----
    Cache<Integer, Person> c = ...
    Person lookupPerson(int id) {
      Person p = cache.peek(id);
      if (p == null) {
        p = retrievePerson(id);
        cache.put(id, p);
      }
      return p;
    }
----

In case `retrievePerson` returns `null` for a non-existing person, it will get called again the next
time the same person is requested. To check whether there is a cached entry `containsKey` could be used.
However, using `containsKey()` and `get()` sequentially is faulty. To check for the existence of a cache
entry and return its value the method `peekEntry` (or `getEntry` with loader) can be used.
The fixed version is:

[source,java]
----
    Cache<Integer, Person> c = ...
    Person lookupPerson(int id) {
      CacheEntry<Person> e = cache.peekEntry(id);
      if (e != null) {
        return e.getValue();
      }
      p = retrievePerson(id);
      cache.put(id, p);
      return p;
    }
----

The cache aside pattern serves as a good example here, but is generally not recommended. Better
use read through and define a loader.

=== Loader and Null Values

If a loader is defined a call of `Cache.get()` will either return a non-null value or yield an exception.
If the loader returns `null`, a `NullPointerException` is generated and wrapped and propagated via
a `CacheLoaderException`. This behavior is different from JSR107/JCache which defines that an
entry is removed, when the loader returns `null`.

In case the loader returns `null` and this should not lead to an exception the following options exist:

- Always return a non-null object and include a predicate for the `null` case, use a list
  or Java 8 `Optional`
- Enable `null` value support
- Remove entries from the cache when the loader returns `null` (as in JCache)

The expiry policy can be used to remove entries from the cache when the loader returns `null`:

[source,java]
----
    ...
    builder.expiryPolicy(new ExpiryPolicy<Integer, Person>() {
      @Override
      public long calculateExpiryTime(K key, V value, long loadTime, CacheEntry<Integer, Person> oldEntry) {
        if (value == null) {
          return NO_CACHE;
        }
        return ETERNAL;
      }
    })
    ...
----

This works, since the cache checks the `null` value only after the expiry policy has run and
had decided to store the value.

=== Performance

Storing `null` values has no additional memory or CPU overhead.

=== Rationale

==== Why support `null`?

Supporting `null` needs a more careful design inside the cache and its API. When
this is done, it basically comes for free and makes the cache very effective for use cases
where `null` values are common.

==== Why is rejecting `null` values the default?

We were using cache2k for 16 years, with the capability to store `null` values by default. For the 1.0 version
we changed this behavior and don't allow nulls. Here is why:

- Most caches do not support `null` values. Allowing `null` by default may lead to unexpected and incompatible behavior.
- Use cases with `null` are rare.
- Returning or storing a `null` may be a mistake most of the time.
- In case a `null` is allowed it is better to specify this explicitly to make the different
  behavior more obvious.

==== Why rejecting `null` from the loader?

If the loader returns `null`, a `NullPointerException` is generated and propagated via
the `CacheLoaderException`. This behavior is different from JSR107/JCache which defines that an entry
is removed, if the loader returns `null`.

The JCache behavior is consistent, since a `get()` in JCache returns `null` only in the case that
no entry is present. The JCache behavior is also useful, since nulls from the loader pass through
transparently. But as soon as nulls are passed through regularly, the cache is rendered useless, since
a `null` from the loader means "no caching". This will be unnoticed during development but will lead to
performance trouble in production.

In cache2k there are different options when `null` comes into play. A failure
by default will, hopefully, lead to an explicit choice for the best option.
