[[osgi]]
== OSGi

The Jar-Files `cache2k-api` and `cache2k-core` currently lack OSGi bundle information. For OSGi users
the bundle `cache2k-osgi-bundle` provided which is a combination of both artifacts including the needed
OSGi meta information.

Eventually `cache2k-api` and `cache2k-core` should become proper meta information and be usable with
OSGi drirectly. Volunteers using OSGi please check https://github.com/cache2k/cache2k/issues/83[GH 83]
