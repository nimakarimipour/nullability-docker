== JMX

=== Containers, ClassLoaders and CacheManager names

The JMX objects are registered at the platform MBean manager. This requires that the cache manager
name is unique within the platform, even if there is a separation by different class loaders.
A good practise to avoid problems, is to set the cache manager name to a unique name for an application.
The name of the default manager can be changed via JNDI, `CacheManager.setDefaultName()` or
the XML configuration.

If manager names within the platform are not unique an ambiguous situation exists that may lead to an
exception or unusable JMX beans. Currently, naming conflicts are silently ignored.

=== Name quoting

Cache and manager names may contain the comma character. If a comma is contained, then it will be quoted
in the JMX value. Quoted and unquoted values for the same key is undesirable, so a comma character should
be avoided in a cache name.
