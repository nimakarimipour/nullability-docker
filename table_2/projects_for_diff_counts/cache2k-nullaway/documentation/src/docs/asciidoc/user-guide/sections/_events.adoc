== Event Listeners

The cache generates events when an entry is inserted or updated.

=== Listening to Events

Event listeners can be added via the cache builder, for example:

[source,java]
----
    Cache2kBuilder.of(Integer.class, Integer.class)
      .addListener(new CacheEntryCreatedListener<Integer, Integer>() {
        @Override
        public void onEntryCreated(final Cache<Integer, Integer> cache,
                                   final CacheEntry<Integer, Integer> entry) {
          System.err.println("inserted: " + entry.getKey());
        }
      });
----

Different listener types are available for insert, update, removal and expiry. The is currently
no possibility to listen to an eviction.

Listeners are executed synchronous, meaning the cache operation will not complete until all listeners
are run. The expiry event is always asynchronous.

WARNING: It is illegal to mutate cache values inside the listeners.

=== Async Listeners

Listeners will be executed asynchronously when added with `addAsyncListener()`. By default a shared unbounded
executor is used. A custom executor can be set via `asyncListenerExecutor`.

WARNING: The cached value is not copied during the cache operation. If a value instance is mutated after
it was handed over to the cache, asynchronous listeners may not see the value as it was present during
the cache operation.
